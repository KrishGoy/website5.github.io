  <p style="font-size:15px;color:darkblue;font-family:'Brush Script MT ',cursive" align="center">Though there are plenty of activities to keep you busy on Phillip Island, don’t forget to soak up some of the atmosphere and character of the island by taking long walks along some of the most scenic beaches. The shore is filled with powdery pale yellow sands and a multitude of shades of blue and salty spray in the air. It is also a good idea to sit on one of the benches facing the beach at Cowes. The sea is usually calm and serene but it is also rough at times and yet holds a kind of fierce beauty which is mesmerising. There are a plethora of birds, mostly gulls, that circle and shriek, which lend an unusual element to the whole scene.

    <p style="font-size:15px;font-family:'Brush script MT',cursive"> Located off ECR in the Kottakuppam Area, this is not exactly a tousist spot but rather a fishing village. The beach, as such, is peaceful and it is possible to enter the waters. The access road from ECR is quite narrow. Plenty of scope for improvement if this is to be developed as a tourist attraction
